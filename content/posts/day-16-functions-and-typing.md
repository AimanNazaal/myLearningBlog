I am celebrating the end of beginners level in typing! I just finished it today. My typing skills were not bad, to start with, but I wasn't very accurate, and I picked up many bad habits over the years. So this course was a good refresher for me. It took me time because it wasn't an easy one. Now I can type with a speed up to 50wpm and at an accuracy level of 98%.

Working more with JS is challenging. It's not problematic at all. It just requires a lot of concentration, repetition, and researching. I can see that the primer raises more questions than providing answers. Their assignments relate to the lessons in one way, but also require researching if one to be able to solve them. 

My strategy with JS is the "baby steps". I am taking it step by step and in little bites, so that I get a solid grasp of it. 

Here is my learning log for this blog.
