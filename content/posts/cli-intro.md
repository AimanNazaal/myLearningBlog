Another successful day in the course with a lot of interactions with other participants. It is interesting to get to know each other even virtually. 

Suzanne has done a great job and really has put a tremendous effort in today's morning session. 

The workload is reasonable and manageable. There is a lot to learn. I have created "To Do List" and I hope I will stick to it. To be a successful developer one should stay abreast of all developments in the field and should develop other important capabilities with logic as the top one of all. 



My learning log for today's blog.
