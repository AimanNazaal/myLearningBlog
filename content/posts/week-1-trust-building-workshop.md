I had real fun yesterday in the Trust Building Workshop and I have enjoyed it to the maximum. Lucy, has really put an effort to make this online session successful and informative at different levels, which is not an easy task, bearing in mind that there were 20 participants online.  

Her exercises have switched me quickly to proactive mode and helped breaking the ice between me and other members of the group. There was a sudden and quick injection of an emerging group dynamics. It was like a wave that I enjoyed riding. 

I could notice that for some participants it wasn't a comfortable ride. Even a couple of participants switched off because maybe they felt that this is not their style or what they expected. It would have been very helpful if Lucy has noticed this and tried to engage them or check what concerns they had. 

My learning log for this blog is below.
