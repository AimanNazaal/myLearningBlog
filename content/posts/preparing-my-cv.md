Updating a CV can be a challenging task. Yet, the satisfaction one can get if the CV grabbed the attention of employers is indescribable. Let alone, when we get the job 

In the past I had a big interest in professional development and in assisting people in formatting and preparing their CV. I even produced videos about this and about how to write a good cover letter. These videos have attracted a fairly large number of audience. 

There is always a room for improvement and I have learnt a lot from this activity. I haven't only updated my CV but also my knowledge. 

Here is my learning log for this blog
