This assignment is really testing my ability to think logically. I am still working on it. It is in a way challenging, but I am not worried that I will be able to crack it. If statements and coding is something new to me, but I trust in my ability to "digest" this type of information. 

I also worked on my typing skills, making some progression that needs to be solidified further in order to reach the needed level of speed.
