The first edition of **Mumpf Daily Standard** is out! Not available online, though. 

It was an interesting activity to try and create a newspaper page. But what is more interesting is finding a story worth publishing. 

Other activities I was engaged in are English on Doulingo, Udemy, as well as some typing. 

Here is my learning log for this blog:

Below are screen shots from the newspaper I created. Far from perfect but it's just the start.

Thank you.
