##### Introduction

My starting date was 28.02.2020. I jumped in swiftly and tried to figure out what I should do. I read the manual and followed the steps to set-up my GitHub account and to link it to Netlify in order to publish my site. 

However, I have continued working on the site till 29.02.2020. I can declare it now ready!  

Here is my first actual learning log for this blog:
