Today was our formal group session to look at cl and git exercises. It was a great idea to have a session with a smaller group like this. 

Also I had my 1:1 session with Suzanne. It was really good to reflect on the week and what went well and what didn't go really as planned from my side. 

It was a fantastic week where everyone has made their best. I am not new to distance learning, so I don't feel that it's odd to sit in front my laptop and listen to lectures. The difference is that in previous courses I used to stop the videos and start them again whenever I wish. But according to Suzanne, sessions will be shorter so that we don't get bored or have a neck pain! 

Here is my learning log for this blog.
