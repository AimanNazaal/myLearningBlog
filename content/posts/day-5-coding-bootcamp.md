I practiced some typing and watched English classes on Udemy. Typing proved to be challenging, but I am progressing - slowly but constantly. 

The bootcamp time is the highlight of the day for me. I have made good progress and developed new skills. 

Here is my learning log for today's blog.

I would like to share with you my work of the day. 

Down here I have tried my best to have the page to look like the one in the task. But for some reason I couldn't manage. I am not sure what went wrong. I added a little bit of padding to the image so that the text looks better, though this is not required in the task. I usually stick to instructions in real professional life. 

The Silly CIA.
