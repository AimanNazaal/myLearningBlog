A day full of various activities related to the programme. 

I have practiced English on Duolingo and some typing. I consider myself having good typing skills,  but it's always good to refresh them as we unconsciously pick bad habits over the years. 

I will focus today in my blog only on the bootcamp primer as it is the main activity that I am concerned about and need to make real progress at in order to make up for my late start. Therefore, my learning log contains information only on the bootcamp.

I also would like to share these images of the first task in the videos. Just the basics.
