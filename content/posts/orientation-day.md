Today morning was the start of the course. I was very excited and happy to meet everyone. It is a little sad that I couldn't meet with everyone in person due to the emergency measures to combat coronavirus, which I hope will end as this topic is causing me serious distress, especially that Jordan is under complete lockdown since 4 days.   

I have done several online courses, but there wasn't any live one-to-one interaction. We used to communicate over the main platform where the tutors post assignments and everyone else post their comments, questions or answers. The overall planning of the day and the session was great, and I enjoyed talking to others during the breakout. 

I have done a short learning log about the day.

Thank you.
