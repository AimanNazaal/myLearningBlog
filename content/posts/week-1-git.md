**Next generation fund** is an amazing concept. Nothing gives me a better feeling of satisfaction and self-worth like being able to payback a good deed and to offer someone else in a similar situation like mine the opportunity to change their life and circumstances. Literally, we can save lives.  

**Git**

As a person coming from non-IT background I always wondered what is Git. Even after I started to become interested in IT and technology in general, I didn't dare to research Git. I was worried that I may not be able to understand it because it is too complex, then I will get frustrated. But after that session about Git I discovered that this monster is just a lovely sweet cat 😃... no not really, it has challenging elements to it, but what I mean is that it was explained really well.
