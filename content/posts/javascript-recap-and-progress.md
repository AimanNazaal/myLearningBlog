**I am taking baby steps** towards becoming conversant with JS and its syntax. Learning is a process which requires humbleness and perseverance. If one is not humble, they will not be able to learn. 



**With humbleness comes open-mindedness and curiosity.**



I won't describe myself as a "fast learner" as I feel that this phrase has been over- and misused. For me it sounds like answering the dreaded interview question, what is your main weakness, by saying "I am a perfectionist!". I wonder how many millions around the world are still using this worn out answer! 



My efforts are so far from being complete or optimum. I am just trying my best to understand JS. I am just dipping my toes into the JavaScript's sea. 



As usual I filled in my learning log to reflect on this experience.

So, I have started by looking again at JS variables and their types, in order to understand how these basic keys enable the vast variation of tools in JS.

Then, I took a look variables and concatement.

A deeper look at functions.

Then, I delved into Arrays.

**Splice!**

Finally, I have put some effort to understand the logic taking place in JS. Of course, the clarity of the logic depends on the style of the developer and how efficient they are.

Thank you. Stay positive.
