I have revisited the same videos on JS data types and  conditionals, as I feel I need to get a good grasp of these building blocks of JS. 

Further, I have spent yesterday and today practising typing, watching English language videos, and a YouTube video about JS, which was recommend to me by Marzieh. 

After yesterday's video call, I spent some time working on a timetable which contains all the info that Suzanne has provided us about the course structure. It is another way to get an overview of what is happening on a daily basis, times for live lessons, and types of activities, so that I can arrange my time and family commitments around this. 

###### Once this timetable is ready, I am happy to share it with anyone who needs it. Just DM me on Slack please. 

Below, is my learning log for this blog.
