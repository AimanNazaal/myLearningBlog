**Ãœbung macht Meister!**



I have started working on the flags next to practicing typing and watching English videos. 

The flags need a lot of attention and can be tricky. However, simplifying the task and how it should be tackled can really help in reaching the goal. It took me time to do just 3 flags. I hope I will finish the rest faster than this patch.
