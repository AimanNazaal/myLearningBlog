**🎖What an epic journey! 🎖**

What a steep learning curve I've gone through in the last couple of days! 

Creating a colour grid sounded so simple and straightforward to me. I was quite sure that I will be able to do this in no time. Even though, I know as a fact that I don't have all needed skills and knowledge. However, I thought I know a little bit about the topic and I need to research for another bit, then I would be cruising across the stylesheet. 

The reality was far from what I imagined. But I can't complain because at the beginning of the bootcamp they warned me that "I will learn the hard way!". 

Frankly speaking, it was an enjoyable challenge. The sense of victory I felt once I cracked it is invaluable. I am looking forward to the next assignment, where I have to create the flags. 

Here is how my grid looks like. Of course it doesn't have the same measures as the one in the assignment, yet it's somewhere around it.

My learning log for this blog is below.

I am still making progress in typing. I must admit its getting better and I am picking up speed. 

Thank you.
