## Aiman Nazaal

I am undertaking a 3-month coding bootcamp at Powercoders Zurich to gain significant coding skills in order to relaunch my career in web development.

In my free time, I write articles and produce videos in Arabic and English languages about blockchain technology, digital currencies, and digital transformation. 

Critical thinking, perseverance, goal setting skills and reliability are some of my characteristics. I keep an open mind and embrace change and technological progress with a flexible mind-set.   

I will be very happy to welcome your visit to my LinkedIn profile to get more information about my professional background.
